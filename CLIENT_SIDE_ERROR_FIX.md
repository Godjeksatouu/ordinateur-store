# Client-Side JavaScript Error Fix

## Problem Description

After deployment, the website was showing a client-side JavaScript error:

```
Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading ordinateurstore.ma

Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Y' before initialization 
    at page-36a5d24fe7ab9653.js:1:1439
```

This error was preventing the site from loading properly in production, while working fine locally.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **incorrect import syntax for the motion library**:

### Problem
- The codebase was using `import { motion } from 'motion/react'`
- This import syntax is incorrect for the `motion` package version 12.12.1
- The bundler was trying to access variables before they were properly initialized
- This created a temporal dead zone error in the minified JavaScript

### Why It Worked Locally
- Development mode has different bundling behavior
- The error only manifested in production builds due to code minification and optimization

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Motion Library Imports

**Before (Incorrect):**
```typescript
import { motion } from 'motion/react';
import { AnimatePresence } from 'motion/react';
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
import { motion } from 'motion';
import { AnimatePresence } from 'motion';
```

### 2. Enhanced Next.js Configuration

Added optimizations to prevent similar bundling issues:

```javascript
// Enable strict mode for better error catching
reactStrictMode: true,

// Optimize bundling for production
experimental: {
  optimizePackageImports: ['motion', '@heroicons/react'],
},
```

## Files Modified

### Motion Import Fixes
1. **`components/shopping-cart/shopping-cart-item.tsx`**
   - Fixed: `import { motion } from 'motion/react'` → `import { motion } from 'motion'`

2. **`components/shopping-cart/shopping-cart-remove-button.tsx`**
   - Fixed: `import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'motion/react'` → `import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'motion'`

3. **`components/shopping-cart/shopping-cart-list.tsx`**
   - Fixed: `import { AnimatePresence } from 'motion/react'` → `import { AnimatePresence } from 'motion'`

### Configuration Updates
4. **`next.config.js`**
   - Added `reactStrictMode: true`
   - Added `experimental.optimizePackageImports`

5. **`next.config.mjs`**
   - Added `reactStrictMode: true`
   - Added `experimental.optimizePackageImports`

## Package Information

The project uses:
- `"motion": "12.12.1"` - This is a wrapper around framer-motion
- `"next": "15.2.2-canary.4"` - Next.js canary version
- `"react": "^19.0.0"` - React 19

The correct import syntax for this version of motion is simply `from 'motion'`, not `from 'motion/react'`.

## Testing Verification

After implementing the fix:

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify in browser:**
   - No JavaScript errors in console
   - Site loads without "Application error" message
   - Motion animations work correctly

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Enable TypeScript Strict Mode
Consider removing these from next.config.js for better error catching:
```javascript
typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: true, // Remove this
},
eslint: {
  ignoreDuringBuilds: true, // Remove this
},
```

### 2. Add Pre-deployment Testing
Add a build test to your deployment pipeline:
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

### 3. Monitor Bundle Analysis
Use Next.js bundle analyzer to catch import issues:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer
```

## Common Causes of Similar Errors

1. **Incorrect import syntax** - Always check package documentation
2. **Circular dependencies** - Use tools like `madge` to detect
3. **Temporal dead zone issues** - Avoid accessing variables before declaration
4. **Version mismatches** - Ensure package versions are compatible

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Use exact versions** in package.json for critical dependencies
2. **Test production builds** before deployment
3. **Enable React Strict Mode** to catch potential issues early
4. **Use proper error boundaries** to handle runtime errors gracefully

## Troubleshooting Similar Issues

If you encounter similar "Cannot access before initialization" errors:

1. **Check import statements** - Verify correct syntax for each package
2. **Look for circular dependencies** - Use dependency analysis tools
3. **Test production builds locally** - Don't rely only on development mode
4. **Check browser console** - Look for specific error locations
5. **Use source maps** - Enable them for better debugging in production

The fix ensures that the motion library is properly imported and bundled, preventing the temporal dead zone error that was causing the application to crash on load.
